# text-classification-20newsgroup
An end-to-end exploration of text classification techniques using the 20Newsgroups dataset. This project implements and compares various document representation methods—from classical symbolic approaches (TF-IDF) and topic modeling (LSA) to modern deep learning architectures using PyTorch and pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe/Word2Vec).
